Slot Machine

Slot machine simulation in python.
The slot machine has 3 rows and 3 columns (parameters that can be changed by the values of the ROWS and COLS variables).
The different symbols represented are "A", "B", "C" and "D".
Their frequencies are contained in the symbol_count variable and their values in the symbol_value variable.
The higher the frequency, the smaller the value but you can change it as you wish.
